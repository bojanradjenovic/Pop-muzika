<p>The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and producer, born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto. He rose to fame in the early 2010s with his dark and emotional sound, combining R&B, pop, and electronic music. His early releases, such as the mixtape <b>House of Balloons</b> (2011), attracted critical attention and quickly placed him at the center of the music industry.</p>
<p>He cemented his global success with albums like <b>Beauty Behind the Madness</b> (2015), <b>Starboy</b> (2016), and <b>After Hours</b> (2020). The song <b>Blinding Lights</b> became one of the most streamed songs of all time, while hits like <b>Can't Feel My Face</b> and <b>Save Your Tears</b> redefined pop music.</p>
<p>The Weeknd is known for his distinctive vocals, dark lyrics, and visually striking performances. His concerts are a true audiovisual experience, often dealing with themes of love, pain, and inner struggle, making him a unique artist on the global stage.</p>
<p>I love his ability to blend musical genres in a way that creates an authentic sound, and to create songs that tackle universal themes like love, loss, and inner conflict. His unconventional vocals, crossing the boundaries of typical pop sounds, contribute to his unique position on the music scene. Also, his approach to visual aesthetics and concerts brings him global popularity and makes each performance unforgettable.</p>
